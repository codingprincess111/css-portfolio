 # Personal Portfolio

 I created a portfolio using html and css to showcase anything about me and my skills as a web developer. Including photos of myself. I did not have a guarentee that my photo above my about me would shift and fill in that blank side of the page, which felt somewhat discouraging, because I wanted some content there, however still learning about how to properly use css styles, alongside parent/child relationship.
